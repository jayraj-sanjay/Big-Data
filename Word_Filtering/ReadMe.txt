Explored PySpark and tried the below functions:
1)Map
2)FlatMap
3)ReduceByKey
4)Filter	
6)NLTK library
7)POS - Parts of Speech tagging

The program reads a book, splits the words in the book and then the stops words are removed.
The words are then tagged using NLTK POS and the words which are tagged as Proper Nouns (NNP) are extracted and sorted in decreasing order of their frequency of occurrence.
